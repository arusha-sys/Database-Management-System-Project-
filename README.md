The Cinema Management System (CMS) is a comprehensive database-driven application designed to manage the complete operations of a movie theater. It provides a centralized platform for administrators and customers to perform all essential tasks efficiently. The system uses CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing critical data entities such as movies, genres, cinema screens, seats, shows, customers, bookings, and payments. Administrators can add new movies and genres, update show timings, modify screen layouts, and delete obsolete records, ensuring that the system always reflects the latest information. Customers can view available movies, browse shows by genre or screen, select preferred seats, make bookings, and manage or cancel their reservations. Each booking is linked to a payment record, which tracks transactions securely. The system also maintains real-time seat availability to prevent double bookings and ensures data integrity through relational database management. By automating these processes, the CMS not only streamlines administrative tasks but also enhances the overall customer experience, providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for modern cinema operations.
